# Virtual Try On & 3D Fitting room

### Try on for accessories and apparels: 
The technology aims to bridge the gap between physical and virtual shopping by enhancinng the userâ€™s  shopping experience .it aims to provide a sustainable,safe and secure digital infrastructure in view of the pandemic.


## Built on: 

### Try on for accessories: 
The tech was built using pose net model, tensor flow, and image processing algorithms. 
Self devised algorithm was made to fit the target on the person.
### Try on for apparels: 
The prototype was build using :
1) Unity
2) C#
3) Blender


## Starting the model on the machine: 

### Try on for accessories: 
->Install the dependency from requirements.txt.                                    
->The following versions are must Python =3.6.5.
